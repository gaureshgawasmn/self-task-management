# Self Task Management App

Welcome to the **Self Task Management App**! This is a simple and effective web application that allows you to manage your tasks by creating, updating, marking as in-progress, or done, and deleting tasks once they are completed. The app is fully hosted and works with your browser's `localStorage` to store tasks, ensuring your tasks persist even when you refresh the page.

   - The task will be saved to `localStorage` automatically.

2. **Manage Tasks**:

   - **Mark as In Progress**: Tasks can be marked as in progress when you're working on them.
   - **Mark as Done**: Once finished, mark the task as done.
   - **Delete Task**: Once a task is done, you can delete it to remove it from the task list.

3. **Persistence with LocalStorage**:
   - Your tasks will remain even if you close the app or refresh the page. The app uses your browser's `localStorage` to store and retrieve tasks.
